# A short course on Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R
by Pedro Henrique Pereira Braga

This is a short course/tutorial I developed to help researchers cover some of the families of phylogenetic comparative analyses of trait evolution and correlation, diversification rates, as well as community structure. My objective is to provide a short background in statistical and comparative phylogenetic methods, to further allow researchers to explore their research questions on their own.

A big part of the inspiration for this workshop came from the book *Phylogenies in Ecology*, by *Marc W. Cadotte* and *Jonathan Davies*, as well as from courses and workshops on ecophylogenetics taught by Dr. *Will Pearse*, Dr. *Jonathan Davies* and Dr. *Steven Kembel*. 

I am progressively adding more material to this document. You can access all topics addressed here in the outline on the right side of this page.

If you would like to provide feedback on this material, do not hesitate to get in touch!  

I will highly appreciate your comments!

Kind regards,

Pedro Henrique P. Braga
